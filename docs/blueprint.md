- Background color: Soft peach (#FAEBD7), a light and desaturated version of coral to create a welcoming, calm background.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#D2691E) to provide contrast on the primary, and bring attention to calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text to offer elegance with readability.
